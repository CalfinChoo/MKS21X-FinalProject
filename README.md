Ever wished for a fun game you can use your terminal to open? (I doubt it) well look no further!! We plan to create a NetHack-like game that draws inspiration from projectile-hell roguelike games such as Enter the Gungeon and Soul Knight. While there might be some spotty features due to our graphics being stuck in ascii-art, we hope you are pleased with this game.
